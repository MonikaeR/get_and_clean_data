My code works as described below:

1. Bind files of test set and train test respectively.
2. Bind two set into one set.
3. Clean names of features.
4. Create names of columns in set.
5. Subset columns with data of subject and activity name.
6. Subset columns with variables mean and standard deviation.
7. Bind subsets form steps 5 and 6 into one table.
8. Add column with name of activity by filtering rows for each activity and mutating column activity_label for 
each activity respectively. After binding columns and rows are ordered.
9. Split set by subject and calculate mean for each column.
10. Split set by subject and calculate mean for each column.
11.Bind sets from steps 9 and 10 and remove 2 rows with mean for subject's label and activity's label
11. Create row names for tidy set(these are columns names in table in step 6).
12. Create column names for tidy set.
